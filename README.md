## AI Contributions

The development of this plugin, including the coding and design, was done almost entirely by OpenAI's GPT-4. This plugin was developed over the course of two days with no prior experience developing Chrome plugins, minimal JavaScript experience, and close to 0 frontend design experience. The icon for the extension was generated by Craiyon V2 with the prompt "A modern icon for a chat application in the color scheme of the ChatGPT logo." The icon was then upscaled using bigjpg.com's AI Image Enlarger.
